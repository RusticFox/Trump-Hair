"Thank you. It's true, and these are the best and the finest hairstyles. 
When modders sends their mods, they're not sending their best. 
They're not sending you. They're not sending you. They're sending mods 
that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. 
They're bringing bad ideas. They're bringing bad textures. They're terrible. 
And some, I assume, are okay."
